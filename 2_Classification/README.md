## 💡 Our Learning Philosophy

> **"From experimental code to production systems."**

At SAIR, we believe **modular, maintainable code separates hobby projects from professional systems**. This module teaches you to architect ML solutions that scale and can be maintained by teams.

**This is where you become an ML engineer, not just a model builder.**

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **For Sequential Learners:**
```bash
# 1. Start with classification fundamentals
jupyter notebook Lecture_4.ipynb

# 2. Learn pipeline transformation
jupyter notebook Lecture_5.ipynb

# 3. Explore the production pipeline
cd Pipeline
python run_pipeline.py
```

### **For Pipeline-Focused Learners:**
```bash
# Dive directly into professional architecture
cd Pipeline
python run_pipeline.py

# Run the Streamlit app
uv run streamlit run streamlit_app/app.py
```

### **Run the Complete Example:**
