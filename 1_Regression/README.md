# Module 1: Regression Mastery 📈

**From Mathematical Foundations to Production Deployment**

**📍 Location:** `1_Regression/`  
**🎯 Prerequisite:** [Module 0: Python Foundations](../0_Python_ML_Foundations/README.md)  
**➡️ Next Module:** [Module 2: Classification & Pipelines](../3_Classification/README.md)

Welcome to the **Regression Module** of **SAIR** – your **first hands-on ML course** where you'll build real models, deploy interactive applications, and solve problems with your own datasets.

## 💡 Our Learning Philosophy

> **"Implement from scratch, then scale with frameworks."**

At SAIR, we believe in **understanding fundamentals before using abstractions**. You'll implement algorithms from scratch to build deep intuition, then use production tools to scale your solutions.

**This module transforms you from a learner to a builder.**

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### **For Sequential Learners:**
```bash
# 1. Start with mathematical foundations
jupyter notebook Lecture_1.ipynb

# 2. Progress to practical implementation
jupyter notebook Lecture_2.ipynb

# 3. Finish with production deployment
jupyter notebook Lecture_3.ipynb
```

### **For Project-Focused Learners:**
```bash
# Start with the capstone project template
cd "Regression Capstone Projects"
# Create your project and refer to lectures as needed
```

### **Run Your Applications:**
```bash
# Streamlit App
uv run streamlit run app.py

# Or using Gradio
python app_2.py
```
