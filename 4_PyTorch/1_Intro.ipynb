    "### Exercise 1: Fix the Bug\n",
    "The following code has a critical error. Identify and fix it.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = nn.Linear(5, 1)\n",
    "optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)\n",
    "\n",
    "for epoch in range(10):\n",

    "```\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** Understand why gradients accumulate and how to fix it.\n",
    "**Success Looks Like:** Loss decreases properly without exploding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Device-Agnostic Function\n",
    "Write a function that:\n",
    "1. Takes a model, data, and device as input\n",
    "2. Moves everything to the specified device\n",
    "3. Trains for 50 epochs\n",
    "4. Returns the trained model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** Code works on both CPU and GPU without modification.\n",
    "**Success Looks Like:** Function runs without device mismatch errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3: Model Debugging\n",
    "Create a simple neural network that's not training (loss stays constant). Include at least two common bugs. Then write debugging code to identify the issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** Practice systematic debugging approach.\n",
    "**Success Looks Like:** Identify both bugs using the debugging workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4: Save and Resume Training\n",
    "Train a model for 50 epochs, save a checkpoint, then resume training for another 50 epochs. Verify the training continues smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Outcome:** Understand checkpoint structure and resuming training.\n",
    "**Success Looks Like:** Loss curve shows continuous training across save/load."
