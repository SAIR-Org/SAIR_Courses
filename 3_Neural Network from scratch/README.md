## 💡 Our Learning Philosophy

> **"What you build from scratch, you truly own."**

At SAIR, we believe **mathematical understanding is non-negotiable** for serious deep learning work. This module takes you beyond framework usage to the fundamental operations that make neural networks work. You'll implement every matrix multiplication, every gradient calculation, every optimization step.

**This is where you transition from deep learning user to deep learning creator.**

## 🏗️ Capstone Project: Two Main Parts

### **Part 1: Build Your Own Neural Network Library** 🧠

**Objective:** Create a complete, modular deep learning library using only NumPy.

#### **Required Components:**
```python
# Core layer implementations
class Dense:
    """Fully connected layer with forward/backward passes"""
    def __init__(self, n_inputs, n_neurons):
        self.weights = None  # You'll implement initialization
        self.biases = None
        self.output = None
        self.inputs = None
    
    def forward(self, inputs):
        """Implement forward pass: inputs @ weights + biases"""
        pass
    
    def backward(self, dvalues):
        """Implement backward pass: compute gradients"""
        pass

# Activation functions with analytical gradients
class ReLU:
    def forward(self, inputs):
        pass
    def backward(self, dvalues):
        pass

class Softmax:
    def forward(self, inputs):
        pass
    def backward(self, dvalues):
        pass

# Loss functions with gradient calculations
class CrossEntropy:
    def forward(self, y_pred, y_true):
        pass
    def backward(self, dvalues, y_true):
        pass

# Optimizers
class SGD:
    def update_params(self, layer):
        pass

class Adam:
    def update_params(self, layer):
        pass

# Model composition
class Sequential:
    def __init__(self, layers):
        pass
    def forward(self, X):
        pass
    def backward(self, y_pred, y_true):
        pass
```

#### **Design Principles:**

## 🔬 Key Concepts You'll Master

### **1. The Mathematics of Forward Propagation**
```python
# What you'll implement:
def dense_forward(X, W, b):
    """Z = XW + b"""
    return np.dot(X, W) + b

def relu_forward(Z):
    """A = max(0, Z)"""
    return np.maximum(0, Z)

def softmax_forward(Z):
    """S = exp(Z) / sum(exp(Z))"""
    exp_Z = np.exp(Z - np.max(Z, axis=1, keepdims=True))
    return exp_Z / np.sum(exp_Z, axis=1, keepdims=True)
```

### **2. Backpropagation from First Principles**
```python
# Manual gradient calculations you'll derive:
def dense_backward(dA, W, A_prev):
    """∂Loss/∂W = A_prev.T @ dA
       ∂Loss/∂b = sum(dA, axis=0)
       ∂Loss/∂A_prev = dA @ W.T
    """
    dW = np.dot(A_prev.T, dA)
    db = np.sum(dA, axis=0, keepdims=True)
    dA_prev = np.dot(dA, W.T)
    return dW, db, dA_prev

def relu_backward(dA, Z):
    """∂Loss/∂Z = dA * (Z > 0)"""
    dZ = dA.copy()
    dZ[Z <= 0] = 0
    return dZ
```

### **3. Optimization Algorithms**
```python
# From basic to advanced:
class SGD:
    """W = W - η * dW"""
    def update(self, params, grads, lr):
        for key in params:
            params[key] -= lr * grads[key]

class MomentumSGD:
    """v = β*v + (1-β)*dW
       W = W - η*v
    """
    def update(self, params, grads, lr, beta=0.9):
        for key in params:
            self.v[key] = beta * self.v[key] + (1-beta) * grads[key]
            params[key] -= lr * self.v[key]

class Adam:
    """Combines momentum and RMSprop with bias correction"""
    # You'll implement the full algorithm
```

### **4. Architecture Design Patterns**
```python
# Simple vs Deep architectures you'll compare:
simple_mlp = [784, 64, 10]           # 1 hidden layer
medium_mlp = [784, 128, 64, 10]      # 2 hidden layers  
deep_mlp = [784, 256, 128, 64, 10]   # 3 hidden layers

# Parameter counts and performance trade-offs:
# Simple: ~50K params, fast training, good for MNIST
# Deep: ~300K params, slower training, diminishing returns
```
